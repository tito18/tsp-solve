Held-Karp algorithms, from https://github.com/CarlEkerot/held-karp, I add three differents matrix, 4x4, 20x20 and 21x21 to compare against the ACO algorithms, from https://github.com/Akavall/AntColonyOptimization, and also I add the sames matrix. 


Final exam math. Original algorithms implements for  https://github.com/CarlEkerot/held-karp and https://github.com/Akavall/AntColonyOptimization
